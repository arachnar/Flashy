# Flashy

A web app that asks flashcard questions and checks typed answers. Made for everyone who wanted a way to use flashcards better. I liked the idea of flashcards but, the self-checking didn't sit well with me, and when I looked for options online, I couldn't find anything which lets you answer in your own words which I really needed as I am not that good at memorising 😅, so I built one. Here is the current [version](arachnar.github.com/Flashy)

## Features
- Case-insensitive checking
- Trims extra spaces
- Instant feedback

## Tech Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## How it works
User types an answer → app compares it with correct answer given by the user→ shows correct/incorrect.

## Future plans
- Spaced repetition
- AI answer checking
- Progress tracking
